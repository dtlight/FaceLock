# FaceLock
Face recognition, door unlock project for "R U Hacking" at Reading University.

We created several prototypes that approached the project in a different way. In the end we were able to demonstrate a working project although not the way we would have desired as it didn't entail the full functionality we envisioned. 

However, given the 24 hour time constraint it was still something achieved, with judges awarding us second place.

Required Libraries (On the pi you can use apt-get install):
python-pip
python-git
python-numpy
python-opencv
cython
imutils
python-sklearn
python-skimage

Acknowledgments:

Prior to tthis weekend we had zero image processessing experience so it's been a tough but super informative 24 hours. This project wouldn't be possible without the use of Open Source Computer Vision Library (Open CV), cam.raspberry pi, Raspberrypi.org and several other resources.

The Open CV library facilitates face recognition and machine learning. You can read more here:
