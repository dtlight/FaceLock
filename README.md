# FaceLock
Face recognition, door unlock project for "R U Hacking" at Reading University.

We created several prototypes that approached the project in a different way. In the end we were able to demonstrate a working project although not the way we would have desired as it didn't entail the full functionality we envisioned. 

However, given the 24 hour time constraint it was still something achieved, with judges awarding us second place.

Working face detection project created earlier today at Reading University's Hackathon
